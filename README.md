# Todo React UI

---

A simple todo ``React`` UI for a `todo service`.

## OpenApi

To generate the `OpenApi` client stubs for the `todo service` the backend service must be running on port `8080`.
As soon as it is running we can run `npm run generate:openapi` in the terminal. This command will create a `api` folder
in the `src` folder where all the client stubs for the `todo service` are located.
